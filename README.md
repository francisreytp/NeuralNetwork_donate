### NeuralNetwork_donate

Two layers with improvements were used: Layer 1 = 100, Layer 2 = 10 neurons / @ 30 epochs

The highest accuracy that was produced was 73% with Loss of 0.58.

I've tried cutting diminishing the number of samples throught outliers
Different combinations as far as column included have also been explored.

There's negligible accuracy change when it comes to increasing the epoch number

I might need to improve on the kinds of layers used and reseach more on the connection
of which columns should be included and excluded in the model.
